			<p>This gift holds my failings for the year.</p>
			
			<p>My first failing, and the least important, is that I couldn’t get a job, and have no money. I’m sorry, I didn’t have money to buy you a nice Christmas gift this year, and so I decided to make one instead.</p>
			
			<p>But my failure to find a job is minuscule in comparison to my other failing, which is my failure to remain faithful to you. I know this has been my biggest failing. And if I could put a picture to this year it is a cactus because there is hurt everywhere. I’ve put you through hell, and no matter where you turned there was pain.</p>
			
			<p>And when you needed me, to make the pain go away, I wasn’t there.</p>	

			<p>You’ve been crying out asking me to take more ownership of this situation, and my behavior, and I haven’t. I’ve been running away because facing yourself is hard, and it hurts. I’m sorry I was such a weak person this year. I’m sorry I didn’t have the character and courage to deal with my problems. That I have been someone who dishonored you, and who you are ashamed of. I’m sorry that I made going home so hard for you, that I turned a safe place into a place filled with hurt. I’m sorry that I refused to listen to you. </p>
