			<p>This gift holds my failings for the year.</p>
			
			<p>My first failing, and the least important, is that I couldn’t get a job, and have no money. I’m sorry, I didn’t have money to buy you a nice Christmas gift this year, and so I decided to make one instead.</p>
			
			<p>But my failure to find a job is minuscule in comparison to my other failing, which is my failure to remain faithful to you. I know this has been my biggest failing. And if I could put a picture to this year it is a cactus because there is hurt everywhere. I’ve put you through hell, and no matter where you turned there was pain.</p>
			
			<p>And when you needed me, to make the pain go away, I wasn’t there.</p>	

			<p>You’ve been crying out asking me to take more ownership of this situation, and my behavior, and I haven’t. I’ve been running away because I refused to do the hard and painful things, and face my demons. I’m sorry that I refused to truly listen to you.</p>

			<p>I’m sorry I was such a weak person this year. I’m sorry I didn’t have the character and courage to deal with my problems. That I have been someone who dishonored you, and who you are ashamed of. I’m sorry that wherever you look you are reminded of what I did to you, and that you have to constantly question. I’m sorry that I made going home so hard for you, that I turned safe places into places filled with hurt.</p>

			<p>Yet you stayed with me through it all. I still can’t wrap my mind around that.  You were the one who had to be strong, and endure the hurt because I chose not to be.</p>

			<p>This year, I have my heart set on making things right.</p>

			<p>And that you will find beneath it all there is still something worthwhile. I hope you see someone that loves you deeply. I want to build a life with you, because I believe we can still build something beautiful. That the fire I created will not destroy our relationship, but refine it into something even greater than we imagined.</p>

			<p>Making this prickly pear cactus brought me back to our first time in Italy (and Texas of course), and the joy I felt even being close to you. It also embodies my desire for this next year, if you will still have me, that while there was pain, and needles still in the skin of your hands, that in your hands you will also hold fruit in a heart that is softened.</p>
			<p>I love you.</p>
			<p>Jonathan</p>
